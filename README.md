# Fluxogram

Fluxogram allows you to define an executable fluxogram, for which an object
is passed, and subsequently processed by a set of nodes. Each node, after
processing, returns a response, which will be used to decide the next node,
based on a set of connections between the nodes, which is also defined by you.
